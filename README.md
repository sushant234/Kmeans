# K-Means Clustering with Mini-Batch and Restarts

This project implements a K-Means clustering algorithm with functionality for mini-batch optimization and multiple restarts. It allows the user to input a dataset, configure parameters like the number of centroids (`k`), iterations, and restarts, and visualizes the clustering results.

---

## Features
- **K-Means Clustering**: A robust implementation of the k-means algorithm.
- **Mini-Batch Optimization**: Efficient handling of large datasets using mini-batches.
- **Multiple Restarts**: Ensures the algorithm finds the best solution by running multiple restarts.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling to manage missing files and invalid inputs.
- **Interactive Input**: Accepts dataset file path, `k`, number of iterations, and restarts as input.
- **Visualization**: Plots distortion costs for different restart numbers.
